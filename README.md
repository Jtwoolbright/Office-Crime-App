# Criminal Intent 

Don't you just hate in when someone leaves the microwave a mess at work? Ever wish there
was a way to catch whoever drank the can of coke you had in the fridge? Well look no further
than Criminal Intent! Criminal Intent is an app that allows you to record office crimes that
can range from leaving dirty dishes in the sink to more serious crimes that require the police.
No one will get away with eating your spaghetti ever again!
